Windows Azure Pack is currently the primary portal self service experience for the Microsoft Private cloud. Originally released as an extension to System Center 2012 R2, the  Azure Pack solution is going to remain in mainstream support until 2022. (Windows Azure Pack support clarification). 

Windows Azure Pack Gallery

One of the highlights of the Windows Azure Pack (also referred to as WAP) is the concept of a gallery, which delivers the ability for self service users to deploy platforms and services which have been pre-created and published for self service consumption by our tenants. 

These gallery items are extensible, and also with a little help from some tools are quite easy to implement. 

# Publicly Available Gallery Items

Microsoft maintains a feed of items which can be published to your own instances of the Windows Azure Pack, consisting of both 1st and 3rd party solutions or offerings, spanning both Windows and Linux platforms. 

The following is a list of all the currently published gallery items which are published in the feed and a brief overview of each of these offerings.
