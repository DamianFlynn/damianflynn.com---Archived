## We're Ritter Insurance Marketing's software development department

[Ritter Insurance Marketing](https://ritterim.com) (RIM) is a Field Marketing Organization (FMO) in the Senior Life and Health Insurance markets. That means we promote and distribute insurance carriersâ€™ products to licensed agents.

RIMdev (catchy, huh?!) develops the tools to facilitate the success of these agents, helping them succeed and better support their clients.

We continue to develop a suite of RIM software products, [Medicare Quote Engine](https://medicarequoteengine.com/), [eBroker Software](https://ebrokersoftware.com)'s embeddable quote engine featuring direct enrollment through [Healthcare.gov](https://healthcare.gov), and [medicareful.com](https://medicareful.com), for over 65 Medicare Health Insurance quotes, while contributing to support Open-Source Software initiatives and speaking.
