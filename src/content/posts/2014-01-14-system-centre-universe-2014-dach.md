Marcel, Thomas, and the team at ITNEX are doing it again. Mark you calendars for the 17th, 18th and 19th of September, and join us in the Congress Center, Basel, Switzerland.

I am delighted to be re-joining the presentation team again this year, and can promise that we will have some fantastic content and new concepts to tear down, and build out.

There are currently no plans for streaming, so book the tickets now to ensure you get a front and center seat; and yes many of the presentations will be in English, so no excuses, as my German is, well, shameful.
