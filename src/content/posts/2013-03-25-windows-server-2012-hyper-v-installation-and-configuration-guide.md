I am still getting it a little hard to believe, but we done it again, and have published book 2![![HyperVBook](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wordpress/2014/08/HyperVBook-239x300.jpg)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wordpress/2014/08/HyperVBook.jpg)

The original team are somewhat back, however this time Hans opted for the role of technical editor rather than author (good call Mate). We also looped in from Microsoft a great mate, and extremely talented Michel Luescher

Over the months, we adopted to a new name for the book, and we are hoping after you read this book, you will understand and agree â€“ Simply put, we call this the Hyper-V 2012 Bible!

Head over to Amazon right now and order a copy, and if you have a copy, head over anyway, and leave your honest feedback! Please!
