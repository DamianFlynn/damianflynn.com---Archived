Its finally here, Microsoft yesterday announced the release of Virtual Machine Manager, Self Service Portal 2.0 (which we will be referring to its short name VMMSSP).

This amazing free add-on offers a lot of new experiences when hosting your own private cloud, including a much needed on-boarding and approval system to simplify the experience of users looking to work in your private cloud, and an end to spread sheets ![Smile](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wlEmoticon-smile.png).

We will take a look at installing and getting this code up and running in our lab a little later, but in the meantime take a nip over to the Microsoft Site and learn more â€“ [www.microsoft.comssp](http://www.microsoft.comssp)

Congratulations to the Team, and good look at Tech-Ed Berlin!
