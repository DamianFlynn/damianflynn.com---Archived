With all the focus now on SMB2.2 Microsoft have snuck a nasty little change into the builds which now REQUIREs that all SMB connections are secured. This is not a problem as long as your SMB storage offers up a secure connection, however there are many Linux devices, and NAS devices (Including Hitachi HNAS) which will not co-operate, and you will be greeted with a meagre reply stating that your not welcome.

As normal a fix is not to hard, and in this case, its a registry setting on the computer, turning off the requirement for secure connections; at least until your targets all fall into line. Keeping it simple the following PS command from an Elevated shell will do the trick

**Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:SYSTEMCurrentControlSetServicesLanmanWorkstationParameters" -RequireSecureNegotiate -Value 0 â€“Force**

No reboot required, it just works
