Shout out to Mr Charles Joy for this one, I have a few comments on the last series of posts for parameters in C# which has proved a slight challenge to get working for some of you. 

Added a small code edit below to represent the new ODATA URI in Orchestrator 2012 RC and newer builds (Line 160)

However this next sample should address all the questions you might have, and also show off the solutions from a VB users perspective.

Give this a shot, you will like it a lot!!!

We will dissect this sample in the next post; but for the geeks out there this should get you unblocked.

Damian
