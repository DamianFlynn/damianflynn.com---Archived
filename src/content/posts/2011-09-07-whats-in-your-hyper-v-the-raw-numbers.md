It is with great pleasure that myself, [Hans Vredvoort](http://www.hyper-v.nu/archives/author/hvredevoort/), and [Aidan Finn](http://www.aidanfinn.com/), can now share the results of the the Big Hyper-V Survey of 2011!

Over the next days we will post our opinions on what we have gathered from the survey, which you have hopefully submitted to, along with 650+ others around the world answering 80 questions on topic’s including:

  * Their Hyper-V project  
  * Their Hyper-V installations  
  * Systems management  
  * Private cloud  
  * Their future plans 

But, why take our opinion – Make your own – We are sharing the RAW Data Publically for you to create your own conclusions.

All we ask is that you reference the source of the information. Grab the [ZIP here!](https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=bd3ef2b8303cd835&sc=photos&uc=1&id=BD3EF2B8303CD835%21643) and share your opinions!
