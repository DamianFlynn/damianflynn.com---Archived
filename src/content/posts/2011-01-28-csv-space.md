So the first order of the day is to check the space on our CSV Volumes of our Hyper-V Clusters. This has just become so much easier now that we can use PowerShell remoting.

I have a simple function created that will enumerate all the CSV Volumes on the server, and report out in a table the Name, Space and Owner node details.

With this function, we can use the remote shell to quickly get the status on our storage space

Got to love it!
