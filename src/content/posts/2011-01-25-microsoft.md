I had the honour of joining [![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image.png) the Microsoft Ireland Sales team today at the Dublin Cloud Power Event. Keynote for the day was opened with _John R. Rymer_, Forrester and _André Berger_, Microsoft EU.

With _Ronan Geraghty_ we spent a little time discussing Infrastructure as a Service, Private Cloud, and some of the experiences learned as we moved from a Highly Virtualised environment to Private Cloud.

One of my big take a way's from the event is that all these Cloud terms and 4 letter abbreviations such as IaaS, PaaS and SaaS still cause a whole lot of confusion.

I am going to spend a little time on this subject as it is critical that we understand what it is we are really speaking of, as this can be made quite simple to understand.

First, we will create a segregation to help with the explanation. Software which you as an IT Pro install on your infrastructure we will classify as **On Premise** and software which is publicly available and ready for use over the internet, Hotmail as an example we will classify as **Cloud**.

Now, lets take these two categories and consider the abbreviations we know about and what they really relate to:

<table cellpadding="2" width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" > <tbody > <tr >
<td width="133" valign="top" >**On Premise**
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >**Cloud**
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >**Example’s**
</td></tr> <tr >
<td width="133" valign="top" >Software Applications
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Software “as a Service”
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Office 365, Hotmail, Google Doc's
</td></tr> <tr >
<td width="133" valign="top" >Development Platform
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Platform “as a Service”
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Windows Azure, SalesForce.com
</td></tr> <tr >
<td width="133" valign="top" >Servers
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Infrastructure “as a Service”
</td>
<td width="133" valign="top" >Virtual Machines
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Next, all we need to consider are the types of Clouds, which actually are not to difficult to segregate out. My description is not very verbose but should tell you enough to help you understand the terms better

<table cellpadding="2" width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" > <tbody > <tr >
<td width="200" valign="top" >**Private Cloud**
</td>
<td width="200" valign="top" >All the Infrastructure to host the Virtual machines are hosted onsite in your organisation and these are offered securely to your customer base
</td></tr> <tr >
<td width="200" valign="top" >**Hosted Cloud**
</td>
<td width="200" valign="top" >All the Infrastructure to host the Virtual machines are hosted offsite by a hosting provider, however these are still only offered securely to your customer base
</td></tr> <tr >
<td width="200" valign="top" >**Public Cloud**
</td>
<td width="200" valign="top" >All the Infrastructure to host the Virtual machines are hosted offsite by a hosting/cloud provider and the service offered is available publicly for everyone to subscribe to.
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Finally, we need to consider what it means to be considered as either Highly Virtualised, or using a Private Cloud.For this topic I am going do dive much deeper and help you not only understand the concept, but guide you in some of the steps to implement the technology to framework a private cloud, So stay tuned!
