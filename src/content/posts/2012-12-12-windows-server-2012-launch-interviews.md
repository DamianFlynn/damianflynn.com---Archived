At the Windows Server 2012 Launch in London last September, I had the honour of spending some time on stage presenting the Windows Server 2012 Cloud Optimized Features - Public & Private Cloud Computing, for both IT Pros and Software Developers with Steve Plank – "Planky"

While not on stage, with Aidan and Thomas we co-hosted the MVP desk with Claire Smyth.

At the event I also had an opportunity to speak with The Register, and IT Pro Cloud Pro regarding my experience to date with this fantastic new operating system.
