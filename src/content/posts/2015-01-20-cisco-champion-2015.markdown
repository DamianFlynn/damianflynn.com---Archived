Well now I am totally lost for words!

Over the last few years I have focused primarily on the fabric which binds the magic and power of our clouds and services hosted within the data centre, with some emphasis networking technologies and software defined networks. Of course I have singled out some specific brands to which I have personal experience with, but never did I expect to be getting an awarded recognition for the work I have done and/or shared on this platform.

But today that is exactly what has just happened!

_Congratulations: Welcome to the Cisco Champions Program 2015!_

_Because of your excellent contributions to the IT community, you have been chosen out of hundreds of applicants, to be a member of the Cisco Champions team in 2015. Congratulations!
