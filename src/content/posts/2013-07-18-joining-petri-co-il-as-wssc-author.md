[![petrimainlogo](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wordpress/2014/08/petrimainlogo.gif)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wordpress/2014/08/petrimainlogo.gif)As we spend time, fine turning our support mechanisms, one of the go-to locations which I spent a lot of time in my early years leveraging was the somewhat infamous “Petri.co.il IT Knowledgebase”.

We, now I am about to announce something which I never  expected to announce, but I am delighted to be joining the authoring team, with sole focus on Windows Server / System Center.

There is a lot to cover, and I have not yet figured out how I am going to segregate the information which will be posted here, and also on the Knowledgebase, but I am sure that over time this I will indeed sort out.

So, If you are interested in keeping up with my sharing's, I suggest you add the new RSS feed [http://www.petri.co.il/author/damian-flynn/feed](http://www.petri.co.il/author/damian-flynn/feed)

I have lots to share, and as i get some of the content organised, I will post some links here to the series as they pull together.

Interesting times ahead
