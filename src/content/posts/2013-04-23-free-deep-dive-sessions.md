If you enjoy MMS and Tech-Ed, either physically or virtually then you are going to love this!

In association with Microsoft a number of MVPs from the Windows Server / System Center disciplines have organised to run weekly technical presentations, illustrating some of the awesome features of the products, and solutions which you can deliver from the software suites. The content is going to be Level 300 and better, which translates to Geek Fest J

![](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wordpress/2013/04/042313_1428_FreeDeepDiv1.jpg)Looking at the line-up of presenters and topics for the next 12 weeks, you are going to be in for treat, with some of the long established heavy hitters out in force, to swing open the lid and starting fiddling with the inner workings, just to make your life easier.

The only requirement is a copy of Lync 2013 client[ (Download)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35450), and an hour of your time, at 4pm GMT once a week.

And just for Bonus shots, we are adding an extra presentation this week on Thursday!

The first session is tonight (23rd April 2013) at 4pm GMT

  * Automating Hyper-V administration with PowerShell   


And on Thursday we have, at the same time of 4pm GTM

  * Keeping your CIO Happy: Executive Score carding with SQL, SharePoint and Operations Manager!   


I will also be joining in the fun a little later with a deep dive on Network Virtualisation 'Under the Hood with PowerShell', but you have to wait a few weeks J
