It is time to spin up another member of the System Center family. We have the sever ready for this after the configuration exercise we just completed with Virtual Machine Manager.

The node should be already joint to the domain, but we do need to assign a static IP address. Lets take a look again at the Server table so we have the relevant data (Highlighted for you)

</td></tr></tbody></table>

Once all this basic work is complete, we will get on with the installation of Operations Manager.  

# Installation

Now, lets start with the easy stuff, and load up your PowerShell console again and we will get this process rolling.

## Service Accounts

From the PowerShell console we need to import the Active Directory module so that we can organise a service account. I suggest you run this step on the domain controller **LAB-SVR01**
    
    Import-Module ActiveDirectory
    New-ADUser -Name "!SCOM Action Account" -SamAccountName !svcSCOMAction -Description "SCOM Server Action Account" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Password") -Path "OU=Services,OU=Operations,dc=damianflynn,dc=demo" 
    New-ADUser -Name "!SCOM SDK Account" -SamAccountName !svcSCOMSDK -Description "SCOM Server SDK Account" -Enabled $true -AccountPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString "Password") -Path "OU=Services,OU=Operations,dc=damianflynn,dc=demo"







Next we will add this service account into the Local Administrators Group of this server also, as SCVMM will check for this privilege during installation. In PowerShell on our new **LAB-SCOM** server we can now execute the following commands, or use the GUI.
    
    $computerName =   "$env:computername"
    $localGroupName = "Administrators"
    $servicename="damianflynn.demo!svcSCOMSDK"
    
    ([ADSI]"WinNT://$computerName/$localGroupName,group").Add("WinNT://$ServiceName")







## Prerequisite Features




We need to get a few more roles and features installed on our server so that we can Install all the components of System Centre Virtual Machine Manager Server.
    
    Import-Module ServerManager
    Add-WindowsFeature AS-NET-Framework,WAS,Web-Common-Http,Web-Asp-Net,Web-Net-Ext,Web-ISAPI-Ext,Web-ISAPI-Filter,Web-Http-Logging,Web-Log-Libraries,Web-Request-Monitor,Web-Http-Tracing,Web-Basic-Auth,Web-Windows-Auth,Web-Digest-Auth,Web-Client-Auth,Web-Filtering,Web-Performance,Web-Dyn-Compression,Web-Mgmt-Console,Web-Scripting-Tools,Web-Mgmt-Service,Web-Metabase,Web-WMI,Web-Lgcy-Mgmt-Console
    ASPAJAX.exe







Once complete, we will have the IIS, and Windows Process Activation Services all installed and ready.




# SCOM 2008 R2




Before we start on the installation of Operations Manager, we do need to complete a little work first. Operations Manager requires two databases to get its services up and running, which we can of course install on our SQL server without much issue.




However, special attention is needed on these databases, so that we do actually create them correctly, as these databases will not be designed to auto-grow, but instead older information will be pruned out of these databases as part of the function of Operations Manager.




To calculate the correct size for these databases there are a number of things that must be considered, otherwise the health and effectiveness of our SCOM environment will be impacted and impeded.




## Database Calculator




Many of the MVPs, and the Operations Manager teams have blogged in details about the importance of sizing these databases. I strongly recommend that you research this topic in greater detail before you begin your production deployment.




On the Operations Manager Blog, you will find a very easy to use Calculator which will help in assessing the correct sizes for your database by providing just 3 key information points – **Number of days to keep data, Number of Client Computers, Number of Server Computers**, and you will then be presented with the calculated size for both database’s you will need.




[http://blogs.technet.com/b/momteam/archive/2007/10/15/opsmgr-2007-database-and-data-warehouse-size-calculator.aspx](http://blogs.technet.com/b/momteam/archive/2007/10/15/opsmgr-2007-database-and-data-warehouse-size-calculator.aspx)

</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >While in the Warehouse database I will just keep 1 years worth of data, for the same number of clients and servers.
</td></tr></tbody></table>


## Create the Databases




Now that we have calculated the size for these databases, we can now progress to the next stage, and actually create the databases. The installer for Operations Manager is only able to create these databases if the installer is executed on the same server as we host the SQL server, however in the LAB we have determined that we will not be installing the Operations Manager server on this same node.




To facilitate this, you will find on the installation media for SCOM a special utility for Creating the Operations Manager Databases on the SQL server.




### DB Create Wizard




In the SQL Server, in our instance this is **LAB-SVR01**, from the Operations Manager Installation media, locate the file **.SupportToolsAMD64DBCreateWizard.exe** and launch this utility




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb252.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image254.png)




After a few moments we will be presented with a Wizard interface, which will assist in creating our required databases. Click on **Next **to proceed




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb253.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image255.png)




On the **Database Information** page we are offered some options to select from. The first of these is the **Database Type** from which we can select if we are to create the **Operations Manager Database** or the **Operations Manager Data Warehouse Database**. We will require both, therefore we will run the wizard a second time to create the alternate database.




Depending on which database you choose to create, you must set the **Database Size** to match the value you calculated in the calculator for this particular database. All the rest of the information on the page will likely be fine.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb254.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image256.png)




When we create the First Database we will be presented with the page **Management Group Configuration** where we need to provide the name of the **Management Server Group** which will be utilized in Operations Manager, and also importantly** Configure Administrators** by selecting the Active Directory Group while will be reprehensive of our Operations Manager Administrators group. In the LAB i am going to stick with the default.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb255.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image257.png)




We are then asked if we are willing to send feedback to Microsoft, this is generally a good idea, but down to your choice.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb256.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image258.png)




We are then complete with the information required for the Wizard to process the request, so as normal for these wizards we are presented a **Summary** to check before clicking on the **Finish** button to implement the databases




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb257.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image259.png)




The wizard will then execute the changes on the SQL Server, and complete the preparation work for us




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb258.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image260.png)




Remember that we need to create both databases with this tool, so you need to run this process two times, once per database.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb259.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image261.png)







## Install Operations Manager




We are now ready to begin the main Installation of Operations Manager. In this LAB deployment I will be installing all the main functions of operations manager on the one server, which will make this process a little less complex with the only exception been the databases which have have now already completed.




Lets being, and after providing the installation media, we will be presented with the Flash Screen for **System Center Operations Manger 2007 R2 Setup. **From which we will select the option **Install Operations Manger 2007 R2**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb260.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image262.png)




After a few moments the Installation Wizard will launch and we can begin the process of deploying Operations Manager




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb261.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image263.png)




After we have viewed the splash screen, we will be presented with the EULA, which we need to accept, and then click on **Next **to progress




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb262.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image264.png)




We can then provide some information about us




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb263.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image265.png)




Next, we get to **Custom Setup** information, where we will deselect the installation of the database components, as these are already complete from the earlier exercise. The rest of the modules are good, so we can continue




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb264.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image266.png)




The Installer will then check to be sure all the Prerequisites are in place. I am getting a warning because i am been stingy with RAM, but otherwise everything else is good.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb265.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image267.png)




Since, we decided not to install the Database with the wizard, the installer still needs to know where to find our databases, so on the **SC Database Server Instance** page, we can point back to the database we created on the **LAB-SVR01** node earlier.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb266.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image268.png)




We also need to provide two service accounts, which we created at the start of the task list, The first one of these is the **Management Server Action Account, **this account is used by the agents to gather information and execute some scripts on the managed computers




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb267.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image269.png)




The Second account is the **SDK and Configuration Service Account** which is used by SCOM to connect with the servers, this account is also a member of the Local Administrators Group on the server




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb268.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image270.png)




We then need to define how we want the authentication to be presented for the web interface, I am going to stick with the default recommendation for Windows Authentication




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb269.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image271.png)




The following screens in the wizard cover providing feedback to Microsoft




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb270.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image272.png)




And, determining how we want to address Updates




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb271.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image273.png)




We are then **Ready to Install the Program** and can click on the magic **Install** button.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb272.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image274.png)




This will start off the process, which will take a little while to complete.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb273.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image275.png)




Once the installation is complete, we are asked if we would like to Launch the SCOM Console, and also Backup the Encryption keys generated to be utilized by the RMS. This step is very important, in the event we need to address any problems or changes the the infrastructure,




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb274.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image276.png)




A few moments after we click on **Finish, **the Wizard will close and the Operations Manager Console will launch to the overview page.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb275.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image277.png)




We can take a quick look about, and should see that monitoring has begun on the Operations Manager node **LAB-SCOM** and we will be looking for a nice Green Check to let us know all is good.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb276.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image278.png)




## Encryption Key




Before we go any further, the installer also launched the **Encryption Key Backup and Restore Wizard **for us. We will use this to make a backup of our current Encryption key.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb277.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image279.png)




After reading the introduction, we can progress to the **Backup or Restore?** page on the wizard. Here we are going to use the **Backup **option.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb278.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image280.png)




We now need to **Provide a Location** to store the copy of our Encryption key, Note that is is sensitive information, so keep safe and secure.

We are then asked to **Provide a Password** to secure this key, just encase it did get into the wrong hands




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb280.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image282.png)




And finally, after a few moments, we should learn that the backup has been completed for us, and we can then **Finish** the wizard.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb281.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image283.png)




At this point we now have System Center Operations Manger 2007 R2 installed in our LAB. However, before we start to use this tool, we should check to see if there are any Cumulative Updates available which we should really consider deploying.




## Installing Cumulative Update 4




The SCOM Cumulative updates are normally Hugh, and CU4 update is no exception rolling in at a staggering 1.26GB! Before we can consider anything else, we need to go and download this beast from Microsoft - [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=39a871e0-d996-4568-be5d-2edb6f539330&displaylang=en](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=39a871e0-d996-4568-be5d-2edb6f539330&displaylang=en)




While this downloads, make yourself comfortable and start reading this [KB 2249679](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=208594) which will get you grounded for the next stages.




### Installation




As we are working on a clean lab we can use the following as a guide to the steps which we will take






  * Download the Update to the node **LAB-SCOM** 

  * Apply the Update to our main server **LAB-SCOM** 

  * Update our SQL Database with the provided Scripts 

  * Import the new Management Pack Versions 






Now, let’s run the installer, which due to its size will take a few minutes to present the **License Agreement**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb287.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image289.png)




The Installer will then present us with some details about the material connected with this update. I can not stress the importance of reading this information enough




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb288.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image290.png)




The following step requests confirmation on where the installer should place the Update, the default location is normally a good option




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb289.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image291.png)




And now we can begin the installation of the update.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image117_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1171.png)




As we mentioned already this is a large update, so the installation will take a few minutes to be processed.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image120_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1201.png)




Before finally returning to us with the **Installation Complete** message




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image126_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1261.png)




After **Closing** to installation Wizard, we should see a new Splash screen, which we must use to install the new updates




#### Apply the Update




At this point we are now ready to Apply the Update to our main server **LAB-SCOM, **as we have just the one server in our environment, we can select the option **Run Server Update**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image123_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1231.png)




After clicking on the option, we will see the following installer start for us. We will need to click on **Next** after the installer loads to actually allow the installation of the update to run.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image132_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image1321.png)




Once the update has completed, the installer will close automatically, however after a few moments we will see the installer start again. This will happen a total of 3 times, as there are 3 different updates which need to be applied in sequence.




Once the installer has completed the 3 passes of applying the different updates we are now ready to move to the next step




#### Update SQL Databases




The next stage in the process is to update the SQL Database. The update is supplied with 2 SQL Queries which we must run, one per database. To do this we will use the **SQL Server Management Studio** which we installed as part of our SQL Server installation on the node **LAB-SVR01.**




Since I have the Update installed on the node **LAB-SCOM** I am just going to map to the location where this update is installed, and find the folder **SQLUpdate** which contains the two queries we need to run. In my LAB this path is _lab-scomc$Program Files (x86)System Center 2007 R2 Hotfix UtilityKB2449679SQLUpdate_




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb290.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image292.png)




Now, with **SQL Server Management Studio** open, I will click on **New Query** to present the query window.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb291.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image293.png)




Next, I will drag the first Query **CU4_Database.sql** into this window, and from the dropdown list of databases, I will then select **OperationsManager** as the active Database




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb292.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image294.png)




And, then Finally, I will click on **Execute** which will run the script and update the database Schema for CU4.




Now, we need to Repeat the process again, this time for the Data Warehouse database. Again from the folder, we will now drag over **CU4_DataWarehouse.sql **into the **SQL Server Management Studio,** and from the drop down I will select the database **OperationsManagerDW **this time. Finally, I will click again on **Execute** to apply this update.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb293.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image295.png)




Now, that was not to painful, we can close out of the **SQL Server Management Studio** again




#### Install updated Management Packs




Now, we can focus on the last stage, Installing the updated Management packs. Before we do this, we should now reboot the Operations Manager Server, so a quick login and reboot of **LAB-SCOM **is now in order.




After the server has rebooted, we can launch the Console, and Navigate to the **Administration** view, where we can select the **Management Packs **options from the administration tree.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb294.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image296.png)




From this view, on the **Actions** pane, we can select the choice **Import Management Packs… **which will launch the **Select Management Packs **Wizard for us. We can then click on **Add** and from the drop down Menu select the choice **Add from disk…**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb295.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image297.png)




The Wizard will then check to see if it can help and fix any dependencies we may need, I am going to say **No** to this currently, but in normal operations of adding new packs I would generally say Yes.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb296.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image298.png)




The browse for files dialogue will open, and we can locate the new updates in the **ManagmentPacks** folder of hotfix we have installed, which was C_:Program Files (x86)System Center 2007 R2 Hotfix UtilityKB2449679ManagementPacks_ and are named:




There are 3 Packs to be imported, I am going to highlight all 3 and click on **Open**






  * Microsoft.SystemCenter.DataWarehouse.Report.Library 

  * Microsoft.SystemCenter.WebApplication.Library.mp 

  * Microsoft.SystemCenter.WSManagement.Library.mp 






[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb297.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image299.png)




These will then be validated, and we can click on **Install** to import these new version Management Packs.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb298.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image300.png)




#### Additional Management Pack Updates




After these updated packs have been imported, I am going to also search to see if there has been any update to the already installed Management Packs which are already installed on our server.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb299.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image301.png)




Again clicking on **Import Management Packs…** this time I am going to select the option **Add from catalogue …** in the wizard, which will present us with a new Dialog. From here I will set the view to **Update available for installed management packs** and click on **Search.**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb300.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image302.png)




After a few moments, we will be presented with the results, which we can check and assuming we are happy with the options provided, Click on **Add** to add these to the list of **Selected management packs** which we will implement. Clicking OK, we will be progressed to the next stage.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb301.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image303.png)




Once we click on **Install** the wizard will download this management packs and then queue them for importing




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb302.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image304.png)




This will take a few minutes depending on the number and size of the packs




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb303.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image305.png)




After which the new packs will be installed, and we can click on **Close** to complete the task




# Configure Operations Manager




Pretty Cool. We now have updated our Operations Manager environment to the current code revision, and we can now add some nodes to be managed by the server.




## Add Managed Nodes




To do this we will stay in the **Administration** view, this time highlighting the **Agent Managed** Node, and right clicking to select **Discovery Wizard** from the context menu




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb304.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image306.png)




This will launch the **Discovery Wizard** for us, where will will select that we are going to discover **Windows Computers** and then click on **Next** to proceed




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb305.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image307.png)




On the **Auto or Advanced** page, I am going to use the Advanced option, so that we can select **Servers Only** for the **Computer and Devices Class** and then clicking again on **Next**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb306.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image308.png)




On the **Discovery Method** I select the choice to **Browse for, or type-in computer names** and then click on the **Browse… **button




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb307.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image309.png)




From here, I search for all the nodes in the LAB starting with the letters **LAB. **From the results presented I then select **LAB-VM01-01, LAB-VM01-02, LAB-SCOM, LAB-SCVMM**




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb308.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image310.png)




After clicking on **OK** the selected nodes are then added to the list of computer names, and I can then click on **Next** to progress again




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb309.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image311.png)




As the Action Account** **is not a domain admin in our lab, I am going to use the Administrators account to deploy the agents to the nodes, the alternative is to add the Action account to the local administrator group on each node, and use it.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb310.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image312.png)




Now the wizard will go searching for the nodes, which will take a few minutes to complete




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb311.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image313.png)




After which, once they have all been detected, we can Click to Enable each of the Nodes, and then click on **Next** to move forward.




[![image_thumb56_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb56_thumb_thumb1.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb56_thumb1.png)




We will then be presented with a **Summary** and the option to change the location where the agent will be installed, and whether the agent should run under normal **Local System** account




[![image_thumb57_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb57_thumb_thumb1.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb57_thumb1.png)




After we click on **Finish** the **Task Status** window will popup and we can watch the process status of the deployment of the agents




[![image_thumb60_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb60_thumb_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb60_thumb.png)




Once the agents have been deployed, the status should changed to **Success**




[![image_thumb61_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb61_thumb_thumb.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb61_thumb.png)




After the Job is complete, we can see the new **Agent Managed** nodes appear in the list




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb312.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image314.png)




We can then change back to **Monitoring **View, selecting **Windows Computers** node to see the newly managed nodes been detected and there current health,




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb313.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image315.png)




## Add Additional Management Packs




To make further use of our Operations Manager installation, I am going to add a few more management packs to our server so that more information can be collected from the servers.




[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb314.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image316.png)




As before we will switch to the **Administration** view, and then chose the option **Import Management Pack…**


<table cellpadding="0" width="400" border="0" cellspacing="0" >
<tbody >
<tr >

<td width="200" valign="top" >[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb315.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image317.png)
</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >As before we will select to add the pack using the online catalogue
</td></tr>
<tr >

<td width="200" valign="top" >[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb316.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image318.png)
</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >This time we will search the catalogue for all packs with the name OS, and then browse the results to find the Windows 2008 Operating System packs
</td></tr>
<tr >

<td width="200" valign="top" >[![image](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb317.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image319.png)
</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >We can now see the list of Packs we chose, and if there are any dependency issues which need to be addressed
</td></tr>
<tr >

<td width="200" valign="top" >[![image_thumb6_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb6_thumb_thumb1.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb6_thumb1.png)
</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >Once we are happy, the server will then download the packs
</td></tr>
<tr >

<td width="200" valign="top" >[![image_thumb7_thumb](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb7_thumb_thumb1.png)](http://blogstorage.damianflynn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image_thumb7_thumb1.png)
</td>

<td width="200" valign="top" >and then after Queuing the up, install them on the server.
</td></tr></tbody></table>


Now, we wait for a little while, Operations Manager will deploy the new Packs to our managed machines which match the packs, and then shortly after start sending back monitoring and management data.




# Conclusion




Time to take another break I think after another good session. There is an awful lot more that we should be looking at within the operations manager environment, however for the purpose of the LAB, I am going to take the short cut, and stick with the essentials for now.
