Its time for The Great Big Hyper-V Survey of 2012, and we want your perspective. Would you believe that 1 year has passed since we launched our first independent Hyper-V survey to get an insight into how you felt, and used Microsoft’s Virtualisation platform, and its supporting management technologies.

## You can participate in the survey [HERE](http://kwiksurveys.com/app/rendersurvey.asp?sid=vtqoy6z8kos3imw25636&refer=)

Well, what a year we have had since then, With the launch of System Centre 2012, a book focused on utilizing this amazing technology to explain, and build our very own Private Cloud; an amazing new version of Hyper-V which is evolutionary packing into Windows Server 2012; and then there is the very latest beta for System Centre 2012 SP1 which enabled a cohesive management framework for this fledgling new operating system.

We learned a lot about how people were using Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V and System Center 2007-2010. Back than, we knew just 2 things about Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V and System Center 2012 was still pre-release. But now, both are generally available, and we want to learn about:

  * Have you learned about these new technologies?  
  * Do you already use them?  
  * Are you planning on using them?  
  * How do you plan to use them? 

Once again, this is a completely independent survey, run by 3 MVPs (Aidan Finn, and Hans Vredevoort and myself), and Microsoft has had no input or involvement. They might help us promote it – because we do know that our findings were read by them and some of the information was a surprise for them.

The goal of the survey is to learn. We’re all bloggers and speakers and we want to deal with what’s relevant. You’re interested in seeing what other people are doing. We all want to learn from each other and we learned a lot last year.

This is a perfect time to speak – if Windows vNext development is like that of Windows Server 2012, then they’ll be spending the next 10-12 months talking, learning, etc. And the same will happen post-SP1 for System Center 2012.

So we ask you to:

  * _Respond to the _[_survey_](http://kwiksurveys.com/app/rendersurvey.asp?sid=vtqoy6z8kos3imw25636&refer=)_ and answer all the questions_. 

There are 72 questions. I know, it’s a lot but there’s a lot of stuff to ask about. We’ll only be using complete responses.

_Share the survey with colleagues, customers, on Twitter, Facebook, blogs, LinkedIn, MySpace_, or whatever work-related social network you are on. We got an amazing response last year and we want to beat that. The more responses we can use, the more reliable the data will be.

Thank you in advance for taking the 10-15 minutes to respond to the survey.

BTW, we don’t ask for or want any personal data or email addresses. No individual response will be shared. We will only be sharing aggregate information, e.g. X people responded with Y answer.

The survey will close on **October 31st**.
