As work on book number two, "[Window Server 2012 Hyper-V Configuration and Installation](http://www.amazon.com/Windows-Server-Hyper-V-Installation-Configuration/dp/1118486498/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1354560382&sr=8-1&keywords=hyper-v+server+2012)" now moves into the editing stages, I am delighted to see that PC Pro have published two of my articles on Windows Server 2012, in a series called "Windows Server 2012, Built from the Cloud Up"
