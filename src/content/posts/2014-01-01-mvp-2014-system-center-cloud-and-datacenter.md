A Picture says 1000 Words, and as it is January 1st we have some celebrating to do. Of course its New Years Day which is cool for sure, but not as cool as getting the new for the 4th year in succession that I have been awarded the coveted Microsoft MVP again.

Thank you,Â  thank Microsoft, and here is hoping your year is also off to a great start.
