# What is the Nexus 1000V?


Cisco Nexus® 1000V Series Switches provide a comprehensive and extensible architectural platform for virtual machine (VM) and cloud networking. The switches are designed to accelerate server virtualization and multitenant cloud deployments in a secure and operationally transparent manner. Integrated into the Windows Server 2012 Extensible Switch, and fully compatible with System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 SP1, the Cisco® Nexus 1000V Series provides:



	
  * Advanced virtual machine networking based on Cisco NX-OS operating system and IEEE 802.1Q switching technology

	
  * Cisco vPath technology for efficient and optimized integration of virtual network services

	
  * Tight integration with System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 SP1

	
  * Layer 2 Switching with Transmit side Rate Limiting

	
  * Security Policy Mobility, inbuilt support for Private VLANs with local PVLAN Enforcement

	
  * Provisioning Port Profiles with deep Integration with SCVMM

	
  * Traffic Visibility, including VM Migration Tracking, NetFlow v.9 with NDE, Cisco Discovery Protocol v.2

	
  * And so much more


These capabilities help ensure that the virtual machine is a basic building block of the data center, with full switching capabilities and a variety of Layer 4 through 7 services in both dedicated and multitenant cloud environments.
