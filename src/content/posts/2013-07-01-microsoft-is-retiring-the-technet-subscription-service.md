Wow, after many many years of Subscriptions, and in more recent times as a Free MVP benefit, this evening I received a mail from Microsoft advising that the Technet Subscription is to be retired.

The following is an extract of the mail, outlining the reasons and what to expect:

__

_As IT trends and business dynamics have evolved, so has Microsoftâ€™s set of offerings for IT professionals who are looking to learn, evaluate and deploy Microsoft technologies and services. In recent years, we have seen a usage shift from paid to free evaluation experiences and resources. As a result, Microsoft has decided to retire the TechNet Subscriptions service and will discontinue sales on August 31, 2013._

_**Subscribers with active accounts may continue to access program benefits until their current subscription period concludes.**_

_We are committed to helping customers through this transition phase and will remain focused on providing IT professionals with free access to a broad set of TechNet assets that support the needs of IT professionals around the world._

_Improved Free Offerings for IT Professionals Include:_

  * _TechNet Evaluation Center: Free evaluation software with no feature limits, available for 30-180 days. Includes rich evaluation resources and TechNet Virtual Labs, which enable you to evaluate software without the need to install bits locally._

  * _Microsoft Virtual Academy: Free online learning site, with over 200 expert-led technical training courses across more than 15 Microsoft technologies with more added weekly._

  * _TechNet Forums: Free online forums where IT professionals can ask technical questions and receive rapid responses from members of the community._

_Please note, MSDN Subscriptions provide a paid set of offerings that are also available for those who require access to evaluation software beyond what the above free offerings provide._

_Thank you for your understanding as we increase focus on growing and investing in our free offerings to better meet the needs of the IT professional community._

_- TechNet Subscription Team_

I guess MSDN is going to be a very important resource, especially as we now get 'Credits' for Azure services.
