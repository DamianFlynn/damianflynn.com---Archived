In co-operation with Savision, I have recently published a white paper over viewing the new networking features in Windows Server 2012, and how these are managed in SCVMM 2012 SP1

The synopsis of the paper is defined in a single sentence:


**"With the launch of Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V, Microsoft introduced to the world its solution for Software Defined Networks, enabling System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 SP1 as their management platform of choice"
**

Supporting this paper, I am hosting two live Webinars on this topic, the first today, and again on Thursday; the presentation will also be recorded for later review. If you are starting into a SCVMM 2012 SP1 project, or curious about what Software Defined Networks is all about, then surf over to the Savision site, and download the paper, and while you are there, connect to one of the live presentations.
