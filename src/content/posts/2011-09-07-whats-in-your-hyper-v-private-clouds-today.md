One of my main focuses with Hyper-V is taking this technology and combining it with some more products to build a Private Cloud infrastructure; but as I speak and Blog, I keep wondering if I am Leading or Training? Is this the correct approach….

Thanks to your great help filling out the Great BIG Hyper-V Survey of 2011, today I can answer some of these questions!

The first answer we need to check off, is how are we managing our Hyper-V Environment; this one is very important, as this will be the base line to start from to assess what percentage of the deployments are potentially been configured as private clouds.[![image6](http://172.21.10.63:84/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image6_thumb.png)](http://172.21.10.63:84/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image6.png)

Now, it would be very to guess that looking at t his information that over 50% of the deployments are been utilized in some for as as private cloud right, But, it might be a big shock to find that over 80% of these installations are NOT managed in any form of a private cloud.

In the remaining 20%, the implementation of Cloud infrastructure has been nicely broken into four categories; with the real surprise turning out to reveal that 30% of these are already using SCVMM 2012 Beta to provide cloud services. If we roll up these numbers further, just 17% of these clouds are not using a version of Microsoft's SCVMM technology

There are 2 questions now that need to be considered, what happens next for the environments using the Microsoft technologies, and of course what will everyone else do?

## 71% will adopt SCVMM 2012 

Well, if the numbers don’t lie, then SCVMM 2012 is going to be a very popular product, Of all the responses 71% will adopt SCVMM 2012 for their private cloud framework. with 16.5% planning to still implement the Self Service Portal Accelerator… Its going to be interesting to see just how that one pans out…[![image15_thumb](http://172.21.10.63:84/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image15_thumb_thumb.png)](http://172.21.10.63:84/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/image15_thumb.png)

That is a whole new world of clouds in the sky, and with that will be a collection of different challenges; but what is interesting here is that concerns which exist with deploying clouds. The big 3 here accounting for over 16% each include the all time favourite Licensing, Meeting SLA’s and Security concerns.

Now considering that Security is top of the worry list, it will not be of any surprise to learn that Firewall integration with private clouds is critical. And this is valid for small companies as well as hosting providers; Multi-Tenancy is a key concept. This is driven home hard and fast when we look at the numbers here – Exactly 50% of the clouds require firewall integration.

Another interesting consideration, is that the second largest concern we have with private could deployments is meeting our SLA’s however when we consider how many of us have, or will deploy Operations manager or Third Partying Monitoring to measure the SLA’s, only 21% of the respondents plan to utilize or implement a technology to assist in addressing this concern, now; the question is – are the 16% of concerned deplorer's inside or outside this Circle???

## Chargeback?

Now, considering that neither Hyper-V nor SCVMM really have an in-box solution for Charge back, the question here really is how much of a product gap is this? Do you need this functionality? After all we need to justify the cloud, so we can manage its elasticity right? Apparently 42% of the respondents do not agree!

Of the remaining 58% this is important information, and something which we do need a solution for. Currently Microsoft's only offering for this is with the Self Service Accelerator, but what will come of that with the new 2012 product suites?

Why is this relevant; simple really 65% of those who do require this chargeback information will use this primarily for the single purpose of justification, to ensure that budgets are supported with valid data, so that new infrastructure can be acquired and be sure that their clouds remain elastic. The remainder, will of course go a step further and Cross Charge the users!

Now, Are you surprised?
