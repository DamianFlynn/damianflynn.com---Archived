Elve 1.2 is about to be released, its currently in late beta, and I just learned that my newest 2 drivers are about to be included in the shipping build.

The first of these will be the **[Clipsal C-Bus](http://www.codecoretechnologies.com/content/Clipsal%20C-Bus%20Driver.ashx) **driver, supports control and monitoring. This driver is coded to interface with the Lighting Application, and to interface to the C-Bus network using the 5500PC module via RS232. This protocol is locked to 9600 Baud, and the driver we reset the interface at start-up

The Second driver will be the **[SageTV Info Popup](http://www.codecoretechnologies.com/content/SageTV%20Information%20Popup%20Driver.ashx)**, which sends messages to the SageTV Infopopup Plug-In. This driver is pretty simple in design and simply allows us to present a popup notification on the SageTV screen. The Service provides no feedback so this driver is a single shoot option

For more details check the [CodeCore Technologies](http://www.codecoretechnologies.com/) site, for the most up to date information.
