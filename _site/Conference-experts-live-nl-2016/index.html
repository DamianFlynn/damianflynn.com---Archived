<h2 id="presentation-abstract">Presentation Abstract</h2>

<p>The Azure Stack solution is designed to no longer leverage the capabilities of Virtual Machine Manager for managing the IaaS resources of the cloud. In this session we will take a close inspection to how the Compute, Network and Storage Resource Provider’s take direction from the Resource Manager. We will also get a glimpse on where these providers live in the current preview, and how they interact with both the fabric and other resource providers.</p>
