Was it really important that my logo be prominently placed? Not really, I am recoding both technical, and product related tips, tricks and news, and not focusing on how to keep a Wordpress site secure, and more importantly working reliably, So I have chosen to leverage static site technology, and ensure the layout focuses on what is truly important, the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-article-should-have-your-sole-attention&quot;&gt;The article should have your sole attention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2017-06-25/old-blog-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;the new content-focused blog&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid border&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hamburger menu - gone. If you’re visiting on mobile, chances are you got here from a link, which means you’re interested in the article. As you move down the article, it’s just content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other standards have worked their way in - how long will it take to read, and how fresh is the content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re visiting on a tablet or larger, you start to see another layer of content/navigation. The 10 most recent article appear as a sidebar. We still want your attention on the article, so content other than a headline is blurred until you hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-move-around&quot;&gt;How do I move around?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the end of the article, you’re presented with related articles (if we can find any based on tags), else you’re given the previous and next articles for additional reading. You can also explore  content by tags, author, or click the binoculars to bring all articles into focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about who we are? As you move back up the article, a footer with light navigation appears. We just keep it out of your way while you’re reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning other features, including posting events; and looking for feedback? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Jekyll" /><category term="UI" /><category term="UX" /><summary type="html">My initial blog had some nice features, but really didn’t do anything to place my content first.
