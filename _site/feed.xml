Was it really important that my logo be prominently placed? Not really, I am recoding both technical, and product related tips, tricks and news, and not focusing on how to keep a Wordpress site secure, and more importantly working reliably, So I have chosen to leverage static site technology, and ensure the layout focuses on what is truly important, the content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-article-should-have-your-sole-attention&quot;&gt;The article should have your sole attention&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/posts/2017-06-25/old-blog-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;the new content-focused blog&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid border&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hamburger menu - gone. If you’re visiting on mobile, chances are you got here from a link, which means you’re interested in the article. As you move down the article, it’s just content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the other standards have worked their way in - how long will it take to read, and how fresh is the content?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re visiting on a tablet or larger, you start to see another layer of content/navigation. The 10 most recent article appear as a sidebar. We still want your attention on the article, so content other than a headline is blurred until you hover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-move-around&quot;&gt;How do I move around?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you reach the end of the article, you’re presented with related articles (if we can find any based on tags), else you’re given the previous and next articles for additional reading. You can also explore  content by tags, author, or click the binoculars to bring all articles into focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curious about who we are? As you move back up the article, a footer with light navigation appears. We just keep it out of your way while you’re reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;whats-next&quot;&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am planning other features, including posting events; and looking for feedback?

# Presentations
I am currently scheduled to present just a single session at the event, and will be joining some of the ask the experts sessions, as well as recording a show discussing Openstack and the Windows Server Fabric.


# Demystified: Azure Stack -  Resource Provider's
## Presentation Abstract

The Azure Stack solution is designed to no longer leverage the capabilities of Virtual Machine Manager for managing the IaaS resources of the cloud. In this session we will take a close inspection to how the Compute, Network and Storage Resource Provider's take direction from the Resource Manager. We will also get a glimpse on where these providers live in the current preview, and how they interact with both the fabric and other resource providers.
