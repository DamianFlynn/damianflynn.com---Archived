<p>Marcel, Thomas, and the team at ITNEX are doing it again. Mark you calendars for the 17th, 18th and 19th of September, and join us in the Congress Center, Basel, Switzerland. <a href="/assets/posts/2014/02/SCU2014DACH.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/2014/02/SCU2014DACH_thumb.jpg" alt="SCU2014DACH" /></a></p>

<p>I am delighted to be re-joining the presentation team again this year, and can promise that we will have some fantastic content and new concepts to tear down, and build out.</p>

<p>There are currently no plans for streaming, so book the tickets now to ensure you get a front and center seat; and yes many of the presentations will be in English, so no excuses, as my German is, well, shameful.</p>
