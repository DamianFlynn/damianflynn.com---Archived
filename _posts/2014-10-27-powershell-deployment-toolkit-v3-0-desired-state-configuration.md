It should come as no surprise that I am an avid fan of the PowerShell deployment toolkit; given the number of posts I have published on this blog and over on perti.com


A quick reminder of some of these posts will include:


  * [Deploying System Center Using the PowerShell Deployment Toolkit](http://www.petri.com/use-powershell-deployment-toolkit-deploy-system-center.htm)
		
  * [PowerShell Deployment Toolkit: Introducing Variables.XML](http://www.petri.com/powershell-deployment-toolkit-variables-xml.htm)
		

But, now with the opening of TechEd Europe 2014, the world is about to be shaken all over again, as Desired State Configuration takes grip of one of my favourite utilities.


If you have not figured out what all the fuss is about, then please, indulge yourself, as this is going nowhere, and we have a lot more amazing stuff to come. The following are some of the posts I posted on the Petri site over the last few months, and could not be more appropriate, than they could be, with the news today we are about to discover

The Guru that is Rob Willis, (who also is about to get Married in the new few days – Congratulations Rob!); has been quietly rebuilding his work of art, the PowerShell deployment tool kit, to deliver today as part of the Desired State Resource Kit – Wave 8 – the xDEPLOY resource; when you crack open this kit you will see the first of this amazing work materialize with the support for the following System Center components included


  * SQL (MS SQL Server) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSQLServer-PowerShell-12d76584](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSQLServer-PowerShell-12d76584)
		
  * VMM (MS Virtual Machine Manager) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCVMM-PowerShell-Desired-0025abcc](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCVMM-PowerShell-Desired-0025abcc)
		
  * SPF (MS Service Provider Framework) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSPF-PowerShell-Desired-128739a5](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSPF-PowerShell-Desired-128739a5)
		
  * SMA (MS Service Management Automation) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSMA-PowerShell-Desired-ee9ed838](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSMA-PowerShell-Desired-ee9ed838)
		
  * SR (MS Service Reporting) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSR-PowerShell-Desired-195ad3c3](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCSR-PowerShell-Desired-195ad3c3)
		
  * OM (MS Operations Manager) - [https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCOM-PowerShell-Desired-052fc73c](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/xSCOM-PowerShell-Desired-052fc73c)

All of these components, are supplied in the kith with individual component examples; in the Windows 2012 R2 series.


But, that's not all, as we are now in the area of threshold, I have been told by an informed insider, that this kit also includes support to deploy System Center Technical Preview, on Windows Server Technical Preview.
