# GitHub How to register for an account

DEVOPS is everywhere and as hard as you might try to ignore it, sooner or later you are going to need to embrace at least some of the benfit's which are offered. In this post we will introduce GIT, GITHUB, and register an account on this free service

## What is GIT?

GIT, a version control solution is one of the most useful pieces of software you will ever embrace. As and IT Pro you will have been haunted by the plauge which is PowerShell, VBScript and many other 'Programming' or 'Scripting' solutions over the course of your creear; and if you are honest you will have had the unfortunate experience of getting the script finally working, only to add an extra tweak which totally broke all your work, and of course you no longer have a copy of that last good version.

GIT is your new best buddy. When used as part of your daily workflow, those nightmares can be put to bed for ever.

GIT is an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds; similar to other version control systems, GIT manages and stores revisions of projects, and can be used to manage any type of file, such as Word documents or Excel spreadsheet. Think of it as a filing system for every draft of a document.

Some of Git’s predecessors, such as CVS and Subversion, have a central "repository" of all the files associated with a project, which required that when a user makes changes, those changes are made directly to the central repository. With distributed version control systems like Git, if you want to make a change to a project you copy the whole repository to your own system. You make your changes on your local copy, then you "check in" the changes to the central server. This enables offline use, and more granular change tracking since you don’t have to connect to the server every time you make a change.

GIT distributed architecture implies that it has the built in ability to be installed on many systems, and can sync between them, while also offering you 100% control over any conflicting versions of files an scripts which you may have on different systems.

We can actually go a step further, GIT is designed to be used by teams, so multiple people can work on the same project at the same time.

This is an awesome piece of software, very lightweight, and if you are really interested, you should check out this free resource [Pro Git 2.0](https://git-scm.com/book)


## What is GitHub?

You may have heard that GitHub is a code sharing and publishing service, or that it’s a social networking site for programmers.

At the heart of GitHub is Git, GitHub is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface. It also provides access control and several collaboration features, such as a wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

The flagship functionality of GitHub is "forking" – copying a repository from one user’s account to another. This enables you to take a project that you don’t have write access to and modify it under your own account. If you make changes you’d like to share, you can send a notification called a "pull request" to the original owner. That user can then, with a click of a button, merge the changes found in your repo with the original repo.

These three features – fork, pull request and merge – are what make GitHub so powerful.

When you submit a pull request, the project’s maintainer can see your profile, which includes all of your contributions on GitHub. If your patch is accepted, you get credit on the original site, and it shows up in your profile. It’s like a resume that helps the maintainer determine your reputation. The more people and projects on GitHub, the better idea picture a project maintainer can get of potential contributors. Patches can also be publicly discussed.

In addition to the public facing open source repositories, GitHub also sells private repositories and on-premise instances of its software for enterprises. These solutions obviously can’t take full advantage of GitHub’s network effect, but they can take advantage of the collaboration features. That’s how GitHub makes money, but it’s not alone in this market.

## GitHub Account

The sign up process for a GITHUB account is very straight forward. you simply need to point your browser to the [GitHub.com site](https://github.com). Once on the site, locate the button for **Sign up** and click it. This will drop you on the page to **Join GitHub**, where we have 3 simple steps to complete.

1. Setup a personal account:  You will need to define a username for your account, along with a contact email address for update notifications; and of course a password for your new account.
2. Choose your plan:  Initially we will begin with the **Free** tier, which offeres No private repositories; once we get more comfortable with the service and using GIT, we can upgrade this plan as required.

That's it! Really! you now have a GITHUB account.

You will be taken to the dashboard, from there we will need to navigate to the **Personal Settings** area, and complete your **Email** verification, failure to validate your mail address will prevent you from contributing to GitHub!

## Next Steps

Now that you have a GitHub account, you will want to establish at least one repository and sync it with a local GIT repository you may already have or clone your new GitHub repository to your local system.
