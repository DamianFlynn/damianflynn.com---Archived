Today, I am starting a new series of Webcasts on SCVMM 2012.

In the first of these recordings, we fly trough the process of installing SCVMM in a HA environment, and complete the initial configuration of the environment by creating some host groups, profiles and adding our Library server.

SCVMM 2012 Installation

In this video, I have already pre-staged the basic Windows File Cluster, Installed the SCVMM Pre-requisite’s and configured the container in AD which will host the Distributed Key required to have the SCVMM nodes communicate. For your environment, I recommend that you refer to the blog post on [SCVMM 2012 Installation](http://www.damianflynn.com/2011/03/22/scvmm-2012installation/) for detailed instructions on putting this framework in place.
