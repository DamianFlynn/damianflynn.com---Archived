Today – during the [announcement](http://www.microsoft.com/business/events/en-us/PrivateCloudExec/#fbid=IqJgx-M_szS) of System Center 2012 RC availability) – seems the perfect occasion to announce our book called **Microsoft Private Cloud Computing**. Mid-2011 four MVP’s decided to make a joint effort at writing a practical book on deploying a Microsoft Private Cloud. The four authors are:

  * Aidan Finn (MVP Virtual Machine [@joey_elway](http://twitter.com/joe_elway))  
  * Patrick Lownds (MVP Cloud and Datacenter Managemet [@patricklownds](http://twitter.com/patricklownds))  
  * Damian Flynn (MVP Cloud and Datacenter Management [@damian_flynn](http://twitter.com/damian_flynn))  
  * Hans Vredevoort (MVP Cluster [@hvredevoort](http://twitter.com/hvredevoort)) 

Aidan writes the introductory chapters on Private Cloud, Hans deals with the Fabric Management (Servers, Storage, Network), Patrick explains the Service Management (VMM Library, Service Modelling) and Damian focuses on Private Cloud Solutions (VMM Services, Self-Service, App Controller).

We also would like to recognise and acknowledge the team at [INOVATIV](http://www.inovativ.nl/) as well as [XS4ALL](http://www.xs4all.nl/consument/?campaignid=gad:branding:sea&gclid=CPvwnrbN160CFQGGDgodwxHflw) (Joey Hofstede, Alexander Rijnbeek) who have have helped us tremendously, by they offered us a remotely accessible lab including HP Blade Servers, HP EVA storage and lots of capacity to test all new VMM 2012 functionality.

We are still busy writing our final chapters and will soon be starting with the editing process. The release of Microsoft Private Cloud Computing is expected just a few weeks after Microsoft Management Summit (MMS12), in May 2012.
