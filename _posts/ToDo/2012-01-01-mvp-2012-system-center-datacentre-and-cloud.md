What a great year 2011 was; I had the opportunity and pleasure to meet a lot of very talented people, while having a lot of fun working on a range of new products from Microsoft ranging from Windows 8 through to the suite of new System Center 2012 products. 

There are far to many people to name, both from within the Microsoft Organisation; the MVP Community, and most importantly you, my peers; but I do want to say a massive thank you to each one of you.

2011 wrapped up on a real high with winning the MMS 2012 Tickets for the SC Orchestrator 2012 CEP; so roll on April, Vegas here I come!

2012 is going to be very exciting, with the Release of System Centre 2012, Windows 8, and of course our Book! (More on this in the coming weeks!)

And of course receiving this message in my mailbox on January 1st is always a fantastic start to a new year
