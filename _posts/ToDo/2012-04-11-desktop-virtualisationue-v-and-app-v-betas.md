Virtualisation is not going away, and just a few days ago Microsoft added more changes in this space for Desktop Virtualization – **User Experience Virtualization** (UE-V). And announced application virtualization product is being updated to its next major version – **Application Virtualization 5.0** (App-V 5.0).

The public betas for both products are available for download today, [UE-V](http://www.microsoft.com/getuev) and [App-V 5.0](http://www.microsoft.com/getappv5), and when fully completed, they will ship as part of the Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP).

As a quick overview,

  * **UE-V** is a user state virtualization product that allows individuals to change devices without reconfiguring applications or settings in Windows 7 or Windows 8.  
  * **App-V **gives IT a more powerful solution to deliver virtually any application, anywhere for a more flexible, integrated and powerful experience across virtualized applications.
