The actual process of subscribing to Windows Azure is relatively easy; all that is required is a Windows Live Account along with a Credit Card which will be charged for any service usage which is beyond the allocation offered in the selected trail or offer.

We start by pointing our Browser to [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure) and selecting from either the Free Trial or Buy options on the site. After selecting the option which is most suitable, you will be required to Sign In with your Windows Live ID or create one if you have none currently.

After signing in you will be presented with a 3 step Wizard
