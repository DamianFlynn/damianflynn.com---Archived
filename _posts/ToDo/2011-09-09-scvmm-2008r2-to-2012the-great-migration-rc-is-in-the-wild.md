It is all happening now, the results are in on the Big Hyper-V Survey of 2011 has made it clear we are building up to the clouds; and Microsoft have now Released to the Web the Release Candidate Build of SCVMM 2012.

This suite of software will be one of the key corner stones in all our MS Private Cloud solutions – Going as far to call this part of the Foundation!

If you have not already looked at the Beta code, or if you found some of the concepts in the Beta odd, and unsure how to correctly implement some of these, then you will be delighted to hear that Networks and a lot more features have been completely restructured.

Go grab the latest and greatest Code on the Microsoft site, and join us as we work on the Great Migration
