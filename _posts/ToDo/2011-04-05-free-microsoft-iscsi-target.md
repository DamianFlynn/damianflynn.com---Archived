If you have been following some of my How-To postâ€™s you will have at some point encountered the stages where we need to provision shared storage for our clusters.

I have been using the Microsoft iSCSI Target software which is part of the Windows Storage Server offering for this purpose. Yesterday, Microsoft publically announced that it was making this Target 100% Free for use and will be production supported. As a user of the target for a few years it has been very stable and worked well for my requirements.

Take a peek over on the [MS Virtualisation Blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/virtualization/archive/2011/04/04/free-microsoft-iscsi-target.aspx) to learn more.
