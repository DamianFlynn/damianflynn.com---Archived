If you are interested in getting a kick start, or a refreshed on PowerShell now that we have access to the CTP of Windows 8, and the RC for System Centre 2012; then you will be very interested to know that the Scripting Guys are starting a week of really good content to feed that appetite.

  * [PowerShell SmowerShell or: Why Bother to Learn Windows PowerShell](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508049&Culture=en-US)  
  * [Heard It Through the Pipeline or: How to Compound PowerShell Commands for Fun and Profit](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508051&Culture=en-US)  
  * [Sole Provider? Not Hardly or: A Look at Windows PowerShell Providers](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508053&Culture=en-US)  
  * [The Main Event or: PowerShell Does Event Logs](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508058&Culture=en-US)  
  * [More than Remotely Possible or: Using PowerShell to Manage the Remote Desktop](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032508060&Culture=en-US)

If you are keeping your head in the sand and ignoring the growing popularity of PowerShell, I can not recommend strong enough to change your mind set; PowerShell is here to stay, and with the new flexibility in Windows 8 to unload the User Experience from any server; you will surely find yourself in trouble quickly if you can not find your way around.

More information on this free and excellent opportunity is available on [The Scripting Guys](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/03/06/windows-powershell-for-the-busy-admin.aspx) Blog.
