During the last two months hundreds of Hyper-V users have taken the time and effort to participate in The Great Big Hyper-V Survey of 2012 which closed last week. We cannot share any details about the results just yet as we are still counting and analysing the results. We'll let you know as soon as we can. Promise!

As a stimulus for you we offered a couple of Microsoft Private Cloud Computing books. Because Aidan Finn said he would select a winner for the book based on the responses he got on his own blog and on Twitter, I still have two books to give away. One is offered by co-author Hans Vredevoort and the other by me.

Quoting Hans:

"After checking the retweets (100+) and who had blogged (15) about the survey, I created a list of about 100 people and assigned them a number. I then asked my two youngest sons Laurens and Steven to just pick a random number between 1 and 100. So based on this method I can congratulate Daniel Neumann @neumanndaniel and Dennis Schut @dennisschut with winning a copy of our Microsoft Private Cloud Computing book! I will approach the winners over the course of next week."

Hans will be signing and sending a copy of the Microsoft Private Cloud Computing to Dennis; while Daniel your copy is making its way from Ireland to you, Congratulations to the both of you. You can look forward to some real light reading for the Christmas break!

Thank you, everyone else for taking the few minutes out of your time to participate in the survey for 2012.

_Extra Special request: If you have already read the book, might we encourage you to write a review and post it on Amazon. We would be very honoured!_
