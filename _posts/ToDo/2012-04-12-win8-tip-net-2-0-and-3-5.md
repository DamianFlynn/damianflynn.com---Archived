On the current builds of Windows 8, the .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.5 require a special process to install, as the the binaries are not copied into the SXS folders during installation.

Thankfully this is an easy fix as long as you have access to the installation media, using the DISM command

**dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFX3 /Source:F:sourcessxs**

_Be sure to replace **F:sourcesxs** with the path to your installation media._
