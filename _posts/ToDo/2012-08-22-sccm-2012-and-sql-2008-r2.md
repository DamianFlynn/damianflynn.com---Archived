After my earlier venture in the troubled waters of SQL database loss, I figured that I had survived the worst that could come. That is until my SQL and Storage guys let me know that due to some on-going concerns with the Cluster, that they planned to destroy and rebuild.

Gasping with the memories, I embraced the situation and opted to proceed with a local SQL 2008 R2 SP1 CU6 installation to be co-hosted on the same servers which are running my CAS and PRI sites. And being the ever so careful personally checked that I had database backups along with Server Backups (VM Snapshots in my case) of both my site servers.

At this point I then proceeded to install SQL2008 R2 SP1 CU6 on each of the two systems, which was pretty event free…

That was until I checked my SCCM environment to find that its broken – and broken badly… it's not starting… Holy Crap what happened now – I just installed SQL… ???

Quickly I check the log file _C:Program FilesMicrosoft Configuration ManagerLogssmsexec.log _to be greeted with repeated messages of non-access to SQL

A quick look around the web, and I located a hint; this issue appears when we have the SQL2008 R2 Native Client utilities installed; which I knew was not the case, as this was working up to a short while ago; I then checked my Primary site, only to see the same issues…




A check of the Add Remove programs on both of these servers however revealed that during the installation of my SQL 2008 R2 SP1 CU6 servers on these systems, that this process did indeed proceed to replace my original SQL 2008 Native Client with the new R2 version…




Using the remove option, I got a number of warnings that this was going to be a bad idea – but stubbornly I chose to ignore and proceed with removing this component. Next I went ahead and installed the original SQL 2008 Native Clients –




**Shortcut**: There is a copy of the sqlnci.exe in the Support Files which SCCM downloads during the installation routine if you have those files kept ;)




Finally, a reboot of the server, and we were back in business.
