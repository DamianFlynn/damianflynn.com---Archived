Itâ€™s official, the next member of the System Centre Family has just reached the Beta milestone and is ready for download right now. take a look at the [SC blog here](http://blogs.technet.com/b/systemcenter/archive/2011/06/15/announcing-the-system-center-orchestrator-beta.aspx) and grab a copy of this really interesting technology.

In this new version Microsoft have dumped the horrid Java console and placed a brand new Silverlight console in its place, and adding this to the main installer, making the complete installation experience 1000 times simpler and faster!!

Out of the box you will get no less than 76 integration components, and that is before you install any of the supplied Integration Packs.

Grab the code, and give it a spin!
