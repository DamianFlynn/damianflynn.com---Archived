Wow, only yesterday I realised that I missed the announcement, and today Microsoft take another step and move this from concept to realty, by offering the solution in Preview Form!

You can get started using this link - [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/preview/](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/preview/)

The first question to come to mind will be Price, which is rather encouraging, on a monthly plan a 1Gb port will cost only €224, with 15Tb outbound included (€0.027/GB after) and Unlimited Inbound… via an Exchange; or if you are working with a Network Service Provider, a 100Mbps port will cost €671 with unlimited in and outbound traffic.

These include dual ports as standard for redundancy, and are 50% discount prices for launch, but even at the full cost, these are numbers we can work with, when we start comparing apples to apples.

Finally, Azure can begin to look like a true datacenter alternative; the next budgeting cycle will be interesting :)

To tease a little more, this is an extract from the over posted here - [http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/expressroute/](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/services/expressroute/)

<blockquote>#### Experience a faster, private connection to Windows Azure
> 
> Windows Azure ExpressRoute enables you to create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure that’s on your premises or in a colocation environment. ExpressRoute connections do not go over the public Internet, and offer more reliability, faster speeds, lower latencies and higher security than typical connections over the Internet. In some cases, using ExpressRoute connections to transfer data between on-premises and Azure can also yield significant cost benefits.  
> 
> With ExpressRoute, you can establish connections to Azure at an ExpressRoute location (Exchange Provider facility) or directly connect to Azure from your existing WAN network (such as a MPLS VPN) provided by a network service provider.
