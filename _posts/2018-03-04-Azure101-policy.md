Managing resources in Azure can be fun, and at the same time insane. It really depends on when you get involved in the process, and how mature your investment in azure is. The first sign of issues is when you realise that you have not being impleming a good naming standard, or costs are starting to get inexplainable.

# Azure Policy

Azure Policy has been introduced as a tool to assit in gaining back control. This feature is plumbed into the heart of the engine which is Azure, the Resource Manager; and enables us to stop bad behaviours as they occur; however it also enables us to report on the past miscongurations which at some point we must atol for.

In its current state there are 36 Policy definations built into the service, with 19 of these tagged as preview; all of which enable us to deny, allow, or audit configurations across the complete resource manager.

## Portal

In the Azure Portal, under the **All Services** item, we can search for the **Policy** service, to open its blade. The blade offers a number of views for us to work from

To make working with policies easier, we have the ability to group up individual polices into a collection which are then referred to as *Initiative's*

In the current service version, Just 1 *Initiative* is offered, which references 13 *policies*

Taking a look at the portal, we have the following views

### Home

### Overview

The landing page for the service provides an overview of the policies which have been assigned to the scope, starting at the subscription. 

Here we can also quickly determine the state of these polices, including *Non-Compiant Initiatices, Polices and Resources*

#### Getting Started

A generic welcome page, pointing you to relevant and useful resources, and shortcuts to other areas within the Policy blade, to find the fruits of your configuration

#### Compliance

Similar to the Overview page, however this view will provide additional context the the results of the compliance checks

### Authoring

#### Assignments

A graphical view to allow us to *Assign Policy*, *Assign Initiative's* and to refresh the view, for assignments which may have been updated outside of this current portal instance.

#### Definations

The primary authoring experience, for creating and maintaing a list of policies which will be useful for our subcriptions. 

Additionally we can also management and maintain the Initiative Definations which group our polices for easier assignment
