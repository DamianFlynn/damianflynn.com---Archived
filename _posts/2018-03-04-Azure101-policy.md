Managing resources in Azure can be fun, and at the same time insane. It really depends on when you get involved in the process, and how mature your investment in azure is. The first sign of issues is when you realise that you have not being impleming a good naming standard, or costs are starting to get inexplainable.

# Azure Policy

Azure Policy has been introduced as a tool to assit in gaining back control. This feature is plumbed into the heart of the engine which is Azure, the Resource Manager; and enables us to stop bad behaviours as they occur; however it also enables us to report on the past miscongurations which at some point we must atol for.

In its current state there are 36 Policy definations built into the service, with 19 of these tagged as preview; all of which enable us to deny, allow, or audit configurations across the complete resource manager.

## Portal

In the Azure Portal, under the **All Services** item, we can search for the **Policy** service, to open its blade. The blade offers a number of views for us to work from

To make working with policies easier, we have the ability to group up individual polices into a collection which are then referred to as *Initiative's*

In the current service version, Just 1 *Initiative* is offered, which references 13 *policies*

![Default Initiative](/images/posts/2018-03-04/default-initiative-defination.png){: .ui.fluid.image}

Taking a look at the portal, we have the following views

### Home

### Overview

The landing page for the service provides an overview of the policies which have been assigned to the scope, starting at the subscription. 

Here we can also quickly determine the state of these polices, including *Non-Compiant Initiatices, Polices and Resources*

#### Getting Started

A generic welcome page, pointing you to relevant and useful resources, and shortcuts to other areas within the Policy blade, to find the fruits of your configuration

#### Compliance

Similar to the Overview page, however this view will provide additional context the the results of the compliance checks

### Authoring

#### Assignments

A graphical view to allow us to *Assign Policy*, *Assign Initiative's* and to refresh the view, for assignments which may have been updated outside of this current portal instance.

#### Definations

The primary authoring experience, for creating and maintaing a list of policies which will be useful for our subcriptions. 

Additionally we can also management and maintain the Initiative Definations which group our polices for easier assignment

## Policy Definations

Right, Time for the real content, let’s look at the policy in more detail. A policy has a condition (when is the policy applied) and an effect (what is the action to take). The simplest example is

You use JSON to create a policy definition. The policy definition contains elements for:

* mode
* parameters
* display name
* description
* policy rule
   * logical evaluation
   * effect

### Overview 

The structure of the rule is as follows

```json
{
  "if" : {
    <condition> 
  },
  "then" : {
    "effect" : "deny"
  }
}
```

The effect can either be deny or audit.

The condition is configured with logical operators.

```json
"if" : {
  "<logical operator>" : {
    "field" : "<field>",
    "condition" : ["<fieldvalue1>" , "<fieldvalue2>"]
  }
}
```

For example, this condition is true if the specified location does not match “northeurope” or “westeurope”

```json
"if" : {
  "not" : {
    "field" : "location",
    "in" : ["northeurope" , "westeurope"]
  }
}
```


For example, the following JSON shows a policy that limits the naming patern for a resource

`azurepolicy.rules.json`
```json
{
   "properties": {
      "displayName": "Match multiple name patterns.",
      "description": "Allows one of multiple naming patterns for resources.",
      "mode": "Indexed",
      "policyRule": {
         "if": {
            "allOf": [
               {
                  "not": {
                     "field": "name",
                     "match": "damian??????"
                  }
               },
               {
                  "not": {
                     "field": "name",
                     "match": "damian-???-##"
                  }
               }
            ]
         },
         "then": {
            "effect": "deny"
         }
      }
   }
}
```

### Mode

Defines which resource types will be evaluated for a policy:

* **all:** evaluate resource groups and all resource types
* **indexed:** only evaluate resource types that support tags and location

By default all policy definitions created through the portal use the *all* mode; however using the CLI you must specify the mode parameter manually.

The **indexed** mode should be used when creating policies that will enforce tags or locations. This isn't required but it will prevent resources that don't support tags and locations from showing up as non-compliant in the compliance results. 

!!! Important "Resource Groups"
    The one exception to this is resource groups. 
    
    Policies that are attempting to enforce location or tags on a resource group should set mode to **all** and specifically target the *Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroup* type.



### Logical Operators

There are three supported logical operators (Not, And, Or)

|Operator | Syntax| Description|
|---|---|---|
|Not  |`"not": {condition or operator}`|Inverts the result of the condition.
|And  |`"allOf": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`|Similar to the logical *And* operation, requires all conditions to be true
|Or   |`"anyOf": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]`|Similar to the logical *Or* operation, requires one or more conditions to be true

You can use nested operators for more advanced policy configuration.


```json
"if" : {
   "not" : {
      "anyOf" : [
         {
            "source" : "action",
            "like" : "Microsoft.Resources/*"
         },
         {
            "source" : "action",
            "like" : "Microsoft.Compute/*"
         },
         {
            "source" : "action",
            "like" : "Microsoft.Storage/*"
         },
         {
            "source" : "action",
            "like" : "Microsoft.Network/*"
         }
      ]
   }
}
```

### Conditions

A condition evaluates whether a field or source meets certain criteria.

|Condition   |Syntax | Notes
|---|---|---|
|Equals      | `"equals": "value"`     | Static Compare
|Not Equals  |`"notEquals": "value"`   | Static Compare
|Like	       | `"like": "value"`       | Can use wildcard `*` 
|Not Like    |`"notLike": "value"`     | Can use wildcard `*` 
|Match       |`"match": "value"`       | `#` to represent a digit, `?` for a letter
|Not Match   |`"notMatch": "value"`    | `#` to represent a digit, `?` for a letter
|Contains    |`"contains": "value"`            | Static Compare
|Not Contains|`"notContains": "value"`         | Static Compare
|In          |`"in": ["value1","value2"]`      | Static Compare
|Not In      |`"notIn": ["value1","value2"]`   | Static Compare
|ContainsKey |`"containsKey": "keyName"`       | Static Compare
|Not ContainsKey|`"notContainsKey": "keyName"` | Static Compare
|Exists      |`"exists": "bool"`               | Boolean Validation

### Fields

Conditions are formed by using fields. A field represents properties in the resource request payload that is used to describe the state of the resource.

|Field| Note|
|---|---|
|`name`     |
|`fullName` | Full name of the resource, including parents *"myServer/myDatabase"*
|`kind`     |
|`type`     |
|`location` |
|`tags`     | Alternative fomatting `tags.tagName` or `tags[tagName]`
|Aliases    | [Policy Aliases](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/policy-definition#aliases)



### Effect

A number of actions can be put into effect based on the result of the match, including

|Effect | Description | Notes
|---|---|---|
|`Deny` | generates an event in the audit log and fails the request
|`Audit`| generates a warning event in audit log but does not fail the request
|`Append`| adds the defined set of fields to the request |
|`AuditIfNotExists`| enables auditing if a resource does not exist
|`DeployIfNotExists`| deploys a resource if it does not already exist. *Currently, this effect is only supported through built-in policies.*

#### Append Effect

For `append`, you must provide the following details:

```JSON
"effect": "append",
"details": [
  {
    "field": "field name",
    "value": "value of the field"
  }
]
```

The value can be either a string or a JSON format object.

#### AuditIfNotExists and DeployIfNotExists

With `AuditIfNotExists` and `DeployIfNotExists` you can evaluate the existence of a related resource and apply a rule and a corresponding effect when that resource does not exist. 

For example, you can require that a network watcher is deployed for all virtual networks. For an example of auditing when a virtual machine extension is not deployed.

## Policy Assignments

Assign Policy Definition
Before the security policy becomes active we need to assign the Policy Definition. It is possible to assign a Policy Definition at different levels.

|Assigned to   |Applies to |Scope
|---|---|---|
|Subscription	|All resource groups and resources in the subscription	|/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/
|Resource Group	|All resources in that Resource Group	|/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}
|Resource	      |Only to that resource	|/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/{namespace}/{ResourceType}/{ResourceName}

First define a variable that holds the PolicyDefinition you want to assign.

### CLI based application

```powershell
$definition = New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Name "enforce-tag-match-pattern" -DisplayName "Ensure that a tag value matches a text pattern." -description "Ensure that a tag value matches a text pattern." -Policy 'azurepolicy.rules.json' -Parameter 'azurepolicy.parameters.json' -Mode All
$definition
$assignment = New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment -Name <assignmentname> -Scope <scope> -PolicyDefinition $definition
$assignment
```

```bash
az policy definition create --name 'enforce-tag-match-pattern' --display-name 'Ensure that a tag value matches a text pattern.' --description 'Ensure that a tag value matches a text pattern.' --rules 'azurepolicy.rules.json' --params 'azurepolicy.parameters.json' --mode All

az policy assignment create --name <assignmentname> --scope <scope> --policy "enforce-tag-match-pattern"
```

## Auditing

After you have assigned one or multiple Policies, event will be logged for each effect. Events with a deny effect are logged with the status Forbidden, events with an audit effect are logged with the action. You can view these events in the Portal or retrieve them through PowerShell with `Get-AzureRmLog`
