System Center is nothing without data, and Microsoft SQL Server is the central repository for all our data; which essentially boils down two a very simple point; we need to ensure that SQL runs at its optimal, and is always available.

My good friend, Paul Keely with _Infront Consulting_ has burned up some of his free hours to gather the latest and greatest facts related to tuning SQL to host our environment, and the results are up for grabs right now for FREE, from the TechNet Gallery!

If you are slightly interested in System Center, this book covers an area which is essentially untouched in any writer documents, and builds on his earlier revision published a few months ago.

In Pauls Own words:


<blockquote>_In this guide I have decided to be very much more focused on SQL and its interaction with System Center and indeed Server 2012.  In the last guide I felt that a lot of people were already installing SQL for quite some time and there was a lot of knowledge out there on SQL installs but not best practices.  SQL 2012 and Server 2012 have brought some real game changers to the story, and because of that this guide is going to go into way more detail on areas like setup and some of the options we have here.  We are not going to walk you through a basic SQL setup, there are a ton of guides for that on the internet, instead we are going to look at some of the more complex areas like clustering, AlwaysOn, Storage Spaces and SQL Azure.  If you are new to this subject then I suggest that you download the guide above and use in in conjunction to this one._</blockquote>
