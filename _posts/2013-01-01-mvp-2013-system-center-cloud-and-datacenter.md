After 2 amazing years, meeting and working with some amazing people, completing my first book ever (I am still trying to get over that one). New Year’s day has become interesting as we cook and monitor the email box, in the anticipation that lighting might just strike again.

And, I am so excited to say it did! Thank you everyone!
