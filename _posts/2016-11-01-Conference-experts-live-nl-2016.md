# Presentations
I am currently scheduled to present just a single session at the event, and will be joining some of the ask the experts sessions, as well as recording a show discussing Openstack and the Windows Server Fabric.


# Demystified: Azure Stack -  Resource Provider's
## Presentation Abstract

The Azure Stack solution is designed to no longer leverage the capabilities of Virtual Machine Manager for managing the IaaS resources of the cloud. In this session we will take a close inspection to how the Compute, Network and Storage Resource Provider's take direction from the Resource Manager. We will also get a glimpse on where these providers live in the current preview, and how they interact with both the fabric and other resource providers.
